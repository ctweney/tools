May 18 meeting notes - Ann Arbor

My focus for next 3 wks: Activity domain model
--make a bundle with pluggable interfaces for the collaborators needed by activity domain, e.g storage layer, auth, etc
--work on kern-2844 to improve cache control filter's config language and make invalidation possible (@Cacheable, @InvalidatesCache, or maybe interfaces to express the same thing)
--flesh out Branden's relational storage model for activities
--explore way to make hibernate's session factory shareable with other components -- also consider eclipselink as alternative orm

Branden: API for synchronous indexing of entities; key-entity storage; REST front-end

Zach: protocol buffers -> voldemort; jenkins -> integratoin tests; conference workshop prep; v1.3 release activities

Carl: Sensei db investigation (we assume)

Ray: fixing Solr's especially painful queries

* pure data objects to be expressed as peas not beans (ie with public members, no getters/setters)
