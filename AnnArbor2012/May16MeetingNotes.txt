The Problems with Sparse
========================

- need to replace it, but do it one piece at a time (ie one domain model item at a time)

* Creating a manager class for each domain model object (eg Activity, Pooled Content, User, Group, Message). This will present an opportunity to inject different impls to allow for integration. 

- all the manager objects will need interfaces to allow pluggable replacement

Branden's presentation on Infinispan
====================================

nakamura core vs. sparsemap:
nakamura core: Content Mgr, Authz Mgr, ACE Mgr
sparsemap SPI: JDBC driver, cassandra driver, mongo driver, etc
* we're talking about replacing sparse SPI but not the nakamura core API
